### Technologies Used
Java: This project was completed using Java\
Scanner: The scanner library is used to get all user input while running the app\
BufferedReader: The buffered reader library is used to read data from a file containing the information about various jets


### Lessons Learned

- Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows us to have objects that can take many forms. This allows us to create many types of jets that still share common functionality. 

- Inheritance: Inheritance allows to share code between classes allowing child classes access to variables and methods in the parent class. 

- Polymorphic array: We can create an array containing objects of different types, so long as both classes have a shared parent. 

- Downcasting and Upcasting may be required to access specific behavior of a class

- the instance of statement can be used with both classes and interfaces

- Try/Catch statements can be used as a safety, in instances where the behavior of the program cannot be certain, such as when getting input from the user.
